I have to shamefully admit I never owned a D20 until recently.  While at the game shop I noticed they sold sets of dice as D4, D6, D8, D12, and D20.  Curious.  What is so special about these shapes?

What is interesting is these shapes are [Platonic solids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid).  Platonic solids look "nice" because every face is the same shape and every angle between every shape is the same.  And what is unbelievable there are only 5 of them!  That bears repeating.  There is a finite number of such shapes, and there are only FIVE OF THEM!  Of all the possible shapes in 3D there are only 5 such shapes?  [Euclid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid) proved this in [Elements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements).

So my first thought was if that was true then what about that trick of [subdividing an icosahedron to tessellate a sphere](https://ziyan.info/2008/11/sphere-tessellation-using-icosahedron/)?  Why doesn't that create a platonic solid with 80 sides?  Its because the first subdivision creates a shape where some vertices terminate 5 edges and others terminate 6 edges.

This is very sad as it mean we can never have an uniform [Geodesic Grid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_grid) larger than 20 faces.  This is because subdivision of a single triangle becomes a four triangles in the shape of a triforce. This means two adjacent subdivided triangles now share a vertex with 6 edges. There does not exist a regular shape with each vertex having 6 edges.

So D20 are popular because that's as large as nice shapes get.
